"""Static profile derivation and the check of a proposal against it (stage 0, MF4).

Rules: tohum/14 (the referee derives the profile itself; a proposal that differs from the derivation is
refused; security paths by keyword and ownership file; excluded directories; agent configuration excluded
everywhere and case-insensitively; the operator's ``excluded_paths``, which a proposal may only widen),
tohum/26a (``profile.derive``: target tree and ``targets[]`` in; profile, unit candidates, excluded paths
out; no side effect), tohum/26b and 26c (field names, the unit recipe), asama-0/08 (unit selection
criteria), asama-0/09 tests 19 and 47, tohum/29d (group ``profile``).

What ``derive`` returns, and the exact rule for each field (all paths are relative to the tree root,
``/``-separated; names are compared after ``str.casefold``):

- Walk. Every entry below the root is visited in name order without following symlinks; a directory
  the walk cannot list stops the derivation (``DeriveError``), it is never skipped. An entry is not
  descended into, and adds nothing to the fields below the excluded ones, when it is excluded: its name
  is one of ``AGENT_CONFIG`` or ``EXCLUDED_DIR_NAMES``, or it matches an operator pattern.
- ``agent_config``: the seven names of tohum/14 (``.claude``, ``CLAUDE.md``, ``AGENTS.md``,
  ``.mcp.json``, ``.vscode``, ``.envrc``, ``.devcontainer``). A path is agent configuration when any of
  its components equals one of them after casefold, at any depth, file or directory. In the tree, a
  symlink whose target text has such a component (``/`` or ``\\`` separated) is agent configuration too;
  the target is not resolved further. Names are compared as stored: a name that differs by a trailing
  space or dot, a Windows short name or a stream suffix is not one of the seven.
- ``excluded_paths``: the operator's ``targets[].excluded_paths`` as written, plus every topmost agent
  configuration path found in the tree (topmost after casefold: ``.claude`` is covered by ``.Claude``).
  An operator entry is a pattern in the ownership-file syntax below, matched case-insensitively.
- ``excluded_dir_names`` and ``excluded_dirs``: a closed list of dependency, cache, build-output and
  other agents' workspace names (``EXCLUDED_DIR_NAMES``); an entry with such a name is excluded, and
  ``excluded_dirs`` lists the topmost ones found. ``.git`` is skipped and not listed. Other names are
  not excluded here; the operator's ``excluded_paths`` is the channel for them.
- ``languages``: ``{name: {files: n}}`` over regular files that are not excluded, by file extension
  (``EXTENSIONS``, casefolded). A file with another extension, or none, counts for no language.
- ``security_paths``: topmost paths (file or directory, symlinks included, excluded ones not) one of
  whose components contains a security keyword as a substring after casefold, plus the regular files
  and their directories matched by an ownership-file line that names an owner (any of them) containing a
  keyword (``CODEOWNERS``, ``.github/CODEOWNERS``, ``docs/CODEOWNERS``, ``.gitlab/CODEOWNERS``, each read
  only when it is a regular file with no symlink on its way). Those lines' patterns are also kept as written in
  ``security_owner_patterns`` so that paths added later are covered. Keywords are the policy's
  ``security_keywords`` when given, otherwise the fourteen of tohum/14. A substring rule over-includes
  (``author`` holds ``auth``); that is its cost, a narrower rule would let a security path through.
  File contents are not read for keywords.
- ``safety_paths`` (tohum/05 "Fiziksel güvenlik": code that drives, stops, alarms for or protects a physical
  process, its thresholds and escalation included): topmost paths found by the same component rule with
  ``SAFETY_KEYWORDS`` (a closed list of this module, the page's six kinds of process in English and Turkish
  plus control-system words: pump, aeration, oxygen, feeding, alarm and alert, emergency stop, shutdown,
  interlock, safety, SCADA, PLC, Modbus, actuator, valve, dosing, heater, chiller, VFD, automation, threshold,
  setpoint, escalation; the policy's keywords do not replace it), plus the paths matched by an ownership-file
  line naming an owner that holds such a word, plus the paths matched by the owner's optional
  ``targets[].safety_paths`` (patterns in the syntax below; an entry that matches nothing in the tree adds
  nothing). Every safety path is also in ``security_paths``, the one list the path gates read
  (``gate.diffguard``, ``loop.decide``, ``unit_verify``'s criterion 5), so nothing derived here is touched
  until K6 is live, formatters included. The owner's list and the keywords only widen the derivation. Out of
  scope: names in no list (a pump driver in ``motor.ts`` under ``devices/``: the owner's ``safety_paths`` is
  the channel) and file contents.
- ``test_path_rules``: the rules of ``TEST_RULES`` that match at least one non-excluded regular file,
  plus, as literal paths, every non-excluded ``.rs`` file with a ``#[test]`` attribute or a ``#[cfg(...)]``
  that names ``test`` (``INLINE_RUST_TEST``; inline tests). A test file outside these rules (say
  ``FooTest.java``, a Python doctest) is not recognised.
- ``unit_candidates``: the operator's ``unit_candidates`` in their order; when there are none, every
  non-excluded directory that holds a ``package.json``, in path order. Each is ``{path, eligible,
  reasons}``; eligible means none of: ``path_invalid`` (absolute, ``..``, empty), ``path_symlink``,
  ``not_a_directory``, ``excluded``, ``safety_path`` or ``security_path`` (the candidate is such a path or lies
  under one, ``guarded_by``; tohum/05: until K6 is live, which is never in this brain, unit selection leaves
  them out, stage 1's first unit included; a candidate that only holds one below it stays a candidate and the
  gates refuse touching that path), ``no_package_json``, ``package_json_unparsable``,
  ``no_version_file`` (no non-blank regular ``.nvmrc`` or ``.node-version``, nor a ``.tool-versions``
  with a ``node``/``nodejs`` line, in the unit directory or an ancestor up to the root), ``no_lockfile``
  (no ``npm-shrinkwrap.json`` or ``package-lock.json`` there; the nearest wins, shrinkwrap first),
  ``lock_not_regular`` (it is a symlink or not a file), ``lock_unparsable``, ``lock_v1_unsupported`` (no
  ``packages`` object),
  ``lock_without_integrity`` (an entry under ``node_modules/`` that is neither a link nor bundled has no
  ``integrity`` string; its value is judged by MF5). These are the static parts of asama-0/08 criteria 1 and 3; "small, well tested",
  the service-free tests, the lint tool, the fixable violation and 3/3 green are not judged here (MF6).

Pattern syntax (operator ``excluded_paths`` and ownership-file lines, GitHub's): a leading ``/`` or a
``/`` inside anchors the pattern at the root, otherwise it matches at any depth; ``*`` and ``?`` do not
cross ``/``, ``**`` does, ``[...]`` is a class; a trailing ``/`` is dropped, so the pattern also matches a
file of that name (wider, never narrower); a match on a directory covers everything below it. Out of
scope: ``!`` negation, escaped spaces, GitLab sections (a line starting with ``[`` or ``^[`` is skipped).

``check(derived, proposal)`` refuses (``ok`` false, every reason listed):

- a field ``derive`` does not produce (``field_not_derived:<name>``), so nothing unjudged gets through;
- ``agent_config``, ``security_keywords``, ``security_owner_patterns``, ``excluded_dir_names``,
  ``test_path_rules`` or the language names that are not equal to the derivation as casefolded sets, or
  ``security_paths`` and ``excluded_dirs`` that, reduced to their topmost paths, are not equal to it
  (``differs:<field>``): narrowing and widening are both refused;
- ``excluded_paths`` that leave out a derived entry (``narrowed:excluded_paths:<entry>``): the brain may
  only widen this list (tohum/14). An entry is kept only by the same pattern (casefolded, trailing ``/``
  dropped) or, when the entry is a glob-free anchored path, by a glob-free pattern that matches it; so
  ``/vendor`` does not keep ``vendor`` (any depth) and ``/legacy/*`` does not keep ``/legacy/*.js``;
- a unit recipe (``units``) whose ``path`` is not an eligible candidate, with a field outside the recipe
  of tohum/26c, with an input that is invalid or excluded, or (given the tree) missing or reached through
  a symlink, or with no input that covers its ``path``. An input that holds an excluded path below it is
  accepted: the exclusion still applies to that path; symlinks below an input are not judged here.

A field the proposal does not carry is not proposed, so it is not compared; only the derivation enters
the profile (tohum/14). Out of scope here: every other ``profile.json`` field (toolchains, commands,
graph, banned constructs, ...) and the recipe's own values (image, commands, limits: MF6).

The functions above are the Python API (``unit_verify`` uses them on a checked-out tree). The command
line is the seed's vector interface for group ``profile`` (tohum/29f, 29d), a separate, smaller rule set
over a tar archive (``derive_vector``, ``check_vector``); it does not run the rules above.

    python -m profile.derive derive TREE.tar.gz OPERATOR.json
    python -m profile.derive check TREE.tar.gz OPERATOR.json PROPOSAL.json

Run from ``referee/``, no stdin; the last (only) stdout line is one JSON object.

- Tree: a gzip tar read in memory; only member names are used, never contents. Directory members are
  ignored; a leading ``./`` is dropped. Any other member type (symlink, link, device, ...), an absolute
  name, or a name with an empty, ``.`` or ``..`` component makes the input unusable.
- ``OPERATOR.json``: an object with ``security_keywords``, ``excluded_paths`` and ``unit_candidates``,
  each a list of strings (other keys are ignored).
- Agent configuration: case-insensitively (``casefold``), a component ``.claude``, ``.vscode`` or
  ``.devcontainer``, or a last component ``CLAUDE.md``, ``AGENTS.md``, ``.mcp.json`` or ``.envrc``.
- Coverage: ``e`` covers ``p`` when ``p == e.rstrip('/')`` or ``p`` starts with ``e.rstrip('/') + '/'``;
  case-sensitive, as written (``src`` does not cover ``srcx/a.py``).
- A file is excluded when it is agent configuration or covered by an operator ``excluded_paths`` entry.
- ``languages``: from non-excluded files by extension, ``.py`` python, ``.js .mjs .cjs`` javascript,
  ``.ts .tsx .mts .cts`` typescript (extension compared as written), nothing else.
- ``security_paths``: non-excluded files whose lower-cased path holds a lower-cased keyword as a substring.
- ``excluded_paths``: the excluded files of the tree.
- ``unit_candidates``: the operator's entries in their order (as written), each kept when it is not
  itself excluded by the file rule above and covers at least one file of the tree, excluded or not.

``languages``, ``security_paths`` and ``excluded_paths`` are sorted in code point order. ``check`` reads a
proposal object carrying the same four lists (missing or of the wrong type: unusable) and prints
``accepted`` (true when ``reasons`` is empty) and the sorted ``reasons``, each at most once:
``differs:languages`` (sets differ), ``differs:unit_candidates`` (lists differ), ``narrows:security_paths``
and ``narrows:excluded_paths`` (a derived path is not in the proposal's list, compared as strings). A
proposal that only widens ``security_paths`` or ``excluded_paths`` is accepted: tohum/14's specific rule
allows widening (29f notes that its general sentence would refuse it; no vector judges this case).

Exit: ``derive`` 0, or 2 when an input is unusable; ``check`` 0 accepted, 1 refused, 2 unusable input.
On exit 2 the line is ``{"error": ...}`` (``check`` adds ``"accepted": false``), never a traceback; any
other exception is exit 2 at ``cli.run``'s boundary (``FAULT_LINE``, the type alone on stderr). Out of scope: signals and the interpreter being
killed.
